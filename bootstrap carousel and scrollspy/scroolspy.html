        <h4 id="scrollspyHeading1">crime and punishment</h4>
        <p>A psychological novel exploring guilt, morality, and redemption, Crime and Punishment follows Rodion Raskolnikov, a poor
        ex-student in St. Petersburg who justifies murdering a corrupt pawnbroker to prove his own superiority. However, his
        conscience torments him, leading to paranoia and inner turmoil. As he struggles with his guilt, he encounters Sonia
        Marmeladov, a kind-hearted woman who offers him a path to redemption.
        
        The novel delves into themes of justice, morality, alienation, and the consequences of one's actions, making it one of
        Dostoevsky’s most profound and enduring works.</p>
        
        <h4 id="scrollspyHeading2">pride and Prejudice</h4>
        <p>"Pride and Prejudice" – Jane Austen
        A classic romance novel that follows the witty and independent Elizabeth Bennet as she navigates issues of class,
        marriage, and societal expectations in 19th-century England.</p>
        <h4 id="scrollspyHeading3">the great gadsby</h4>
        <p>The Great Gatsby" – F. Scott Fitzgerald
        A critique of the American Dream, this novel follows the mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his tragic pursuit of
        wealth and lost love during the Roaring Twenties.</p>

        <h4 id="scrollspyHeading4">no longer human</h4>
        <p>"No Longer Human" – Osamu Dazai
        
        A semi-autobiographical novel, No Longer Human is a deeply introspective and tragic exploration of alienation,
        self-destruction, and the struggle to fit into society. The story follows Ōba Yōzō, a man who feels disconnected from
        the world around him and masks his true feelings with a facade of humor and charm. As he spirals into addiction,
        depression, and self-doubt, he becomes increasingly unable to relate to others, leading to his eventual downfall.
        
        This novel is considered one of Japan’s most important literary works and reflects Dazai’s own personal struggles with
        despair and societal expectations. Its themes of existential crisis and personal failure continue to resonate with
        readers worldwide.</p>
        <h4 id="scrollspyHeading5">white night</h4>
        <p>A poignant and bittersweet novella, White Nights follows an unnamed narrator, a lonely and dreamy young man who wanders
        the streets of St. Petersburg at night. One evening, he encounters Nastenka, a sorrowful yet hopeful young woman. Over
        the course of four nights, they share their deepest thoughts, dreams, and fears, forming a brief but intense emotional
        connection. The narrator falls in love, but his hopes are crushed when Nastenka chooses to reunite with her long-lost
        lover.
        
        The story beautifully captures themes of loneliness, longing, and the fleeting nature of happiness, characteristic of
        Dostoevsky’s deep psychological insight.
